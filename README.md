# Unischeduler
* This program is intended for students in universities where Oracle Peoplesoft Campus Solutions is used
* Unischeduler converts your schedule from text to an icalendar format to export into any known calendar service (google calendar, apple calendar, outlook calendar, etc)
* The utility is now outdated. The new version can be used from here: https://scheduler.oatmeal.cc
